# P2P-ERC20-Rollup
## Introduction
Bitcoin was created in 2009 with the purpose of facilitating peer-to-peer payments in a decentralized network using a new virtual currency. Ten years later blockchain technology has come a long way and mamy other case uses have emerged. However, the main use case, peer-to-peer payments is yet to reach mass adoption.
The repositories in this organization contain a modified optimistic stack that allows the creation of a rollup solely focusing on peer to peer transfer of a specific ERC20 token.
This means execution of ONLY transfers and no additional logic.
